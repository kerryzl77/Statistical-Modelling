The X matrix is constructed as a design matrix with the intercept term and the size class variable. The eta vector is computed as the linear predictor using the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters. The W matrix is a diagonal weight matrix with the elements given by the inverse of the variance of the binomial distribution, i.e. data$Secondary.net / data$Main.net. The V matrix is the variance-covariance matrix of the parameter estimates, which is computed using the sandwich estimator.

The standard error of the maximum likelihood estimate of the probability is given by the square root of the diagonal element corresponding to the size class variable in the V matrix. The 95% Wald confidence interval is then computed as the maximum likelihood estimate plus or minus 1.96 times the standard error, transformed using the inverse logistic function.
